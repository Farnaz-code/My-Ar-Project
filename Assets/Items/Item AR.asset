  - "Production of the organic cotton sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and
    people by using natural processes rather than artificial inputs. Importantly
    organic cotton farming does not allow the use of toxic chemicals or GMOs (genetically
    modified organisms). Instead, it combines tradition, innovation and science to
    benefit the shared environment and promote a good quality of life for all involved.
    No toxic chemicals are used in the growing of organic cotton. It doesn\u2019t
    damage the soil, has less impact on the air, and uses 88% less water and 62%
    less energy."

  donationExplain:
  - "Garment is in the perfect condition for donation or putting on sale in the platform\u2019s
    market, 85% of all the garment at this phase has been sold on the market."
  - "Garment is still in a very good condition for donation or putting on sale in
    the platform\u2019s market, 78% of all the garment at this phase has been sold
    on the market. Usually you need to decrease the price by 30% "
  - "Garment is still in a good condition for donation or putting on sale in the
    platform\u2019s market, 67% of all the garment at this phase has been sold on
    the market but you need to ask for a price which is almost half of what you paid."
  - "Garment still can be donated or put on sale in the platform\u2019s market, 26%
    of all the garment at this phase has been sold on the market. The price should
    be something less than 30% of what you paid."
  - "Garment is not really in a good condition for donation or putting on sale in
    the platform\u2019s market, 10% of all the garment at this phase has been sold
    on the market but can make a perfect floorcloth for you! :) "
  - "Garment can not be donated or putting on sale in the platform\u2019s market
    but can make a perfect floorcloth for you! Also you can think of disposal now.
